	<b>Research Fellow, Microsoft Research India, Bangalore [July, 2016 - Present]</b> 
	<br /> Mentor: Dr. Manik Varma, Principal Researcher
	<br /> 
		Working on Extreme Classification research and its applications in various Microsoft Products (such as Bing Text Ads Recommendations)
		I've worked on improving many ads recommendation products in Bing Ads, namely Text Ads, Dynamic Search Ads, and Product Ads. 
		These efforts have led to significant gains in terms of the quality and impact. 
		In terms of the research impact, I've contributed on SwiftXML and Parabel in the extreme classification research.

	<br />
		I've worked on improving the performance of the client application which includes the start up time, tuning render cycles, memory management and backend optimizations. 
		My efforts reduced the application start time to 20 seconds from the initial 60 seconds. This was a much appreciated work which also helped me in getting promoted within a one year.

	<b>Intern Software Engineer, Bing, Microsoft India Development Center, Hyderabad [May, 2013 - July, 2013]</b> 
	<br /> Mentor: Ashish Shah, Principal Software Engineering Manager
	<br />
		I had developed a phone number annotators which was part of the bigger data mining project aimed at extracting local entities(name, phone number, address, etc.) from the business webpages.
		I had used finite-state transducers to create this annotator while parsing the webpage. The final evaluation resulted in above 90% precision and recall. 
		This was generic extractor for all the Bing markets. It was finally deployed to the pipeline. 
		Due to my excellent work here, I was offered a full-time position which I accepted and ended up joining Dynamics team in Bangalore.
