I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electical and Computer Engineering Department at College of Engineering, Boston University. I am part of [Prof. Venkatesh Saligrama](https://sites.bu.edu/data/)'s lab.  I'm currently working on constrained learning, and efficient deep neural architectures. Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Machine Learning &amp; Optimization Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-and-optimization/) at Microsoft Research, India, where I worked with [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/) on [Extreme Classification](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html). I was an undergraduate student at [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in) where I obtained my B. Tech. in Computer Science in 2014. I worked on Live Streaming via Peer to Peer Overlay Networks with [Prof. Diganta Goswami](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/dgoswami/) for my undergraduate thesis. I've also worked as a Software Engineer for two years at Dynamics CRM, Microsoft India Development Center, Bangalore.
